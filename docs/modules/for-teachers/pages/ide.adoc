= Online IDE

Code FREAK ships with an online IDE that can be used by students to edit their answers without leaving the browser.
The current IDE is based on Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VSCode) that has been ported to the browser by the https://github.com/cdr/code-server["Coder" Team] and the Community.
VSCode does not only allow editing source code files but also makes it possible to compile and debug a full application.
Because you cannot run arbitrary programming languages in your browser the IDE use a backend service running inside a Docker container which does the actual work, like modifying files, compiling code and executing programs.
The UI in the browser will delegate all tasks to the server.
Thus, it is currently not possible to communicate with local hardware like USB devices (microcontrollers, â€¦).

== Features of the Online IDE

Basically, the Online IDE has the same features as VSCode.
Here are some highlights:

* Supports every major programming language.
See VSCode's https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview[official documentation] for a full list of supported languages.
* Compatible with VSCode Extensions
* Smart Auto-Completion (IntelliSense)
* Supports drag&drop for files from the local machine into the browser

== Default IDE image

By default, Code FREAK uses the Docker Image https://hub.docker.com/r/cfreak/ide[cfreak/ide].
It contains the compiler and extensions for a few basic programming languages (Python, Java, C/C++, C#, NodeJS).
For a full list of pre-installed languages and extensions please check the readme of our https://github.com/codefreak/ide#pre-installed-languages--vscode-plugins[IDE repository].

== Custom IDE images

If you need a different version of extensions and/or compilers you have to create a custom version of the IDE image manually.
To modify only some settings of VSCode you can make use of the https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-file-locations[`.vscode` workspace directory] and place a `settings.json` there.

As a starting point you can use the https://github.com/codefreak/ide/blob/master/Dockerfile[`Dockerfile`] of our IDE repository.
Customize the Dockerfile for your needs and publish it to Docker Hub.
Docker provides an official documentation how to get started with Docker and how to create, run and share images https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[here].

=== IDE image requirements

IDE images have to fulfill the following requirements:

* It publishes a webserver on port `3000` (on all IP addresses!)
* The containers runs with the user `coder` and group `coder`
* Project files are stored at `/home/coder/project/`

=== Use a custom IDE image

Each task may use a custom IDE image.
You can either configure this via `codefreak.yml` or in the UI.
The following is a `codefreak.yml` with the default settings:

.codefreak.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
ide:
  enabled: true <1>
  image: cfreak/ide <2>
----

<1> For new tasks the IDE is enabled by default. The IDE can be disabled by setting `ide.enabled` to `false`. This will remove the IDE option for students.
<2> Optionally, you can provide a custom Docker image like described in the previous section.

You can configure the same settings in the UI at `Task > Edit Details > Online IDE`.

== Customizing the default IDE image
The default IDE Docker image based on VSCode ist published as
https://hub.docker.com/r/cfreak/ide[`cfreak/ide`] on Docker Hub.
Check out https://github.com/codefreak/ide[our official source repository on GitHub] to find out which extensions come preinstalled with this image.

Based on this image you can create your own customized IDE with additional plugins or other default settings. The following example Dockerfile installs an additional Extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin[`TSLint`] from the VSCode Marketplace.

[source,dockerfile]
-----
FROM cfreak/ide:1

RUN code-server --install-extension ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin <1>
-----

<1> You will find the unique identifier of your desired extension on the VSCode Marketplace

Place you custom `Dockerfile` in a dedicated directory on your machine and build it. Please check out the official Docker documentation on how to create, build and publish your first image https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/[here].

If you build your image successfully, e.g. with the tag `my-ide-image`, you can try it out locally with the following command. This will launch a VSCode instance on port 3000 that you can open in your browser via `http://localhost:3000`.

[source,shell script]
-----
docker run --rm -itv$PWD:/home/coder/project -p3000:3000 my-ide-image
