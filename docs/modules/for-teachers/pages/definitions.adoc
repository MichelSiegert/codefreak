In Code FREAK, assignments and tasks can be defined YAML files. This includes the configuration of automated evaluation.

[[assignment]]
== Assignment

An assignment is defined by a directory (or packaged archive) containing a `codefreak.yml` with the following schema.

[cols="1,1,3"]
.Assignment Object
|===
|Field Name |Type |Description

|title
|`string`
|**REQUIRED.** The name of the assignment.

|tasks
|`[string]`
|List of paths to <<task,task definitions>> (relative to the assignment).
|===

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
title: My Assignment
tasks:
  - my-task-1
  - my-task-2
----

.Corresponding file structure
----
├─ codefreak.yml
├─ my-task-1
│  ├─ codefreak.yml
│  ├─ main.c
├─ my-task-2
│  ├─ codefreak.yml
│  ├─ ...
├─ ...

[[task]]
== Task

A task is defined by a directory (or packaged archive) containing source code files and a `codefreak.yml` with the following schema. The `codefreak.yml` will be excluded from the source code files.

[cols="1,1,3"]
.Assignment Object
|===
|Field Name |Type |Description

|title
|`string`
|**REQUIRED.** The name of the task.

|description
|`string`
|Detailed instructions for students. Basic markdown is supported.

|hidden
|[`string`]
|Patterns of files that should be hidden from students. Matching files are only included for evaluation. If matching files are created by students, they are ignored for evaluation.

|protected
|[`string`]
|Patterns of files that should be read-only. Students will be able to see matching files but modifications are ignored for evaluation. Non-existent files can be protected to prevent their creation.

|evaluation
|[<<evaluation,Evaluation Step Object>>]
|List of automatic evaluation steps.
|===

TIP: File patterns use the Ant pattern syntax. For more information refer to the https://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns"[official documentation].

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
title: My Task
description: Write a function `add(int a, int b)` that returns the sum of `a` and `b`
hidden:
  - src/test/**
  - .codeclimate.yml
protected:
  - build.gradle
  - settings.gradle
evaluation:
  - step: codeclimate
  - step: junit
----

[[evaluation]]
== Evaluation

Automatic evaluation consists one or more steps. Each step is implemented by a so-called runner.
Runners take the student submissions and execute e.g. static code analysis. They then collect the results to give feedback to the student and support the teacher's grading. The same runner can be used in multiple steps (usually with different configuration). An evaluation step is defined as follows.

.Evaluation Step Object
|===
|Field Name |Type |Description

|step
|`string`
|**REQUIRED.** The name of the runner. See below for supported ones.

|title
|`string`
|An optional human readable name for the evaluation step. Summarize briefly for your students what this evaluation step checks (e.g. "Test functions.py", "Class XYZ Tests", "Code Style", ...). The default title depends on the runner.

|timeout
|`integer`
|An optional custom timeout in seconds after which the evaluation step will be canceled and marked as failed. There is a system-wide default timeout of 5min.

|options
|Map[`string`, ?]
|Runner-specific configuration. See below for details.
|===

[[commandline]]
=== Command Line Runner
Name: `commandline`

This is the most basic runner. It executes arbitrary commands and uses the output as feedback. The evaluation result is based on exit codes of the commands.

[cols="1,1,3"]
.Command Line Runner Options
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|image
|`string`
|**REQUIRED.** The name of the Docker image in which the commands are run.

|project-path
|`string`
|**REQUIRED.** Absolute path of where the student submission is placed.

|commands
|[`string`]
|List of commands that executed. Working directory is the `project-path`.

|stop-on-fail
|`boolean`
|Whether to stop when the first command fails or always execute all commands. Default is `true`.
|===

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
evaluation:
  - step: commandline
    options:
      image: gradle
      project-path: /home/gradle/project
      commands:
        - pwd
        - gradle test
        - ls build/test-results/test
----

[[codeclimate]]
=== Code Climate Runner
Name: `codeclimate`

This runner performs static code analysis via https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate[Code Climate^]. It is configured by including a `.codeclimate.yml` in the task files. See https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/advanced-configuration[official documentation^] for details.

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
evaluation:
  - step: codeclimate
----

.Example .codeclimate.yml
[source,yaml]
----
plugins:
  sonar-java:
    enabled: true

[[junit]]
=== JUnit Runner
Name: `junit`

This runner executes unit tests in Java projects via https://junit.org[JUnit^]. It is pre-configured to work with standard https://gradle.org/[Gradle^] projects.

[cols="1,1,3"]
.JUnit Runner Options
|===
|Key |Type |Description

|image
|`string`
|Inherited from <<commandline,Command Line Runner>>. Default is `gradle`.

|project-path
|`string`
|Inherited from <<commandline,Command Line Runner>>. Default is `/home/gradle/project`.

|commands
|[`string`]
